# Beyond NPCs: AI for Game Operations

### What is "Central and Strategic Analytics"?<br>
- Small group of Analysts / Scientists not embedded with stakeholders
- "Central"<br>
  -> Covering teams that don't have dedicated coverage<br>
- "Strategic"<br>
  -> Focus on cross-division / cross-company opportunities<br>
  -> Novel uses of AI / ML techniques<br>

### A Philosophy of AI<br>
- In general we would like AI systems (in a business context) to be one or more of:<br>
  ðŸ”¹Assistive to humans<br>
  ðŸ”¹Better than humans<br>
  ðŸ”¹Faster than humans<br>
- Drive operational efficiency<br>
- Move humans up the value chain<br>

### Mobile Advertising<br>
- A game -> Mediator --$$$--> Ad Networks <--- Advertisers<br>

### The ZOE Framework<br>
- ZOE<br>
  Data Ingest -> Cleaning and Aggregation -> Clever stuff -> Post Processing -> Ad Network Configurations -> Ad Sales -> Individaul Ad Network Performance Reports -> Data Ingest (loop)<br>

### What is "Clever Stuff"?
- Modulatr system means we can test different strategies<br>
  -> We experiment extensively with different:<br>
  ðŸ”¹Algorithms<br>
  ðŸ”¹Update cadences<br>
  ðŸ”¹Orderings (e.g. CPM-order vs best-fill order)<br>

- Algorithms<br>
  -> Tried a range of strategies<br>
  ðŸ”¹Predicting price direction based on market trends<br>
  ðŸ”¹Linear programming with bin packing<br>
  ðŸ”¹Simulation-based approaches<br>

### Outcomes<br>
- Incredibly hard to quantify results here<br>
- our stack doesn't allow us to A / B test<br>
  ðŸ”¹ We have no control over the market performance of 'A' and 'B', which are sold as distinct entities<br>
- Lots of squinting at charts has yielded<br>
  ðŸ”¹We know we can mess up - so our system CAN drive results<br>
  ðŸ”¹Our system is now driving comparable results vs human operators<br>
  ðŸ”¹We think that we're driving upside in revenue<br>
  ðŸ”¹High frequency updates seem to have a negative impact<br>
- This is not yet rolled out across the entire portfolio

### User Acquisition<br>
- Related but very different problem<br>
- How do you optimize your UA budget alloocation?<br>
- At a meta-level, focus on "Return on Ad Spend" (RoAS)<br>
  ðŸ”¹For a fixed budget, how do I allocate across all the different places I could spend this<br>
  ðŸ”¹Maximise aggregate RoAS<br>
- Also opportunites around targeted acquisition<br>
  ðŸ”¹"How much would you bid for this kind of player?"<br>
  ðŸ”¹How have players like this enjoyed the game before?<br>

### Likely to...<br>
- Propensity modeling is low hanging fruit of Data Science<br>
- Train classifiers based on historical data<br>
  -> Label is based on what happened next<br>
- Use to predict future behavior from more recent data<br>
- Example: Likely to lapse<br>
  ðŸ”¹Use a historical dataset of what the player did in game<br>
  ðŸ”¹Label based on whether they left the game or not<br>
  ðŸ”¹Train a classifier to predict the label<br>
  ðŸ”¹Run against recent data<br>
=> Suggest some promotions<br>

### personalized Game Experience<br>
- More holistic, deeper use of player models<br>
- Cater the experience to match your likes and dislikes<br>
- People who enjoy the game are motivated to support the developer<br>
- Incentivize people - optimize for fun experiences<br>
- Modulate live operations on the fly<br>
  -> Real time decision making<br>

### Summary<br>
- AI can cover a lot more than just pathing and behavior<br>
- Thinking strategically about AI to support your business<br>
- Opportunities to use AI exist everywhere<br>
  ðŸ”¹Advertising<br>
  ðŸ”¹User Acquisition<br>
  ðŸ”¹Personalization<br>
  ðŸ”¹And more...<br>
- Open your eyes and use your skills EVERYWHERE <br>
