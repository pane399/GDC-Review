# Beyond Game Design
## Building a Positive Design Culture<br>
How soft skills lead to strong teams<br>

- Negative Mindsets<br>
  1. "I'm the designer, let me do my job"<br>
   -> What you're saying doesn't matter<br>
  2. "I know best"<br>
   -> I know best, you know nothing<br>
  3. "Give me feedback, not designs or solutions"<br>
   -> Tell me what I want to hear the way I want to hear it<br>
  4. "This is the design we approved"<br>
   -> I don't want to listen to you or reflect on feedback<br>
  5. "Trust me"<br>
   -> I don't trust you<br>

=> Stop Trying do my job!<br>

### Ability to Inspire<br>
- Design Goals<br>
  What problems is your design trying to solve?<br>

- Inspiring the Team<br>
  1. Create Goals with Peers<br>
  2. Build Design with Devs<br>
  3. Pitch Both to the Team<br>
   
  Confusion / Concern?<br>
  -> Do they still believe in the goals?<br>

- "Ability to Inspire" Mindsets<br>
  "I'm the designer, let me do my job"<br>
  -> "It's my job to own the vision and empower the team to own the game"<br>
  "I know best"<br>
  -> "If you don't believe, that's on me"<br>

### Patience & Understanding<br>
- Interpreting Feedback<br>
  "I want a gun that kills everything in one shot!"<br>
  -> I want to feel powerful<br>
  "This game is pointless"<br>
  -> I don't feel like my actions are having an impact on the world<br>
  
  1. Ask Questions: "What problem are you trying to solve?"<br>
  2. Reiterate the Issue: "So what you're saying is..."<br>
  3. Resolve the Issue : "What if we do X, does that resolve your concern?"<br>

  You can solve it, but should you?<br>
  -> Does the solution align with your goals?

- Breaking Down Walls<br>
  Scenario 1: It can be integrated<br>
  Scenario 2: It already exists<br>
  scenario 3: Conflicting goals<br>

- "Patience & Understanding" Mindsets<br>
  "Give me feedback, not designs or solutions"<br>
  -> "Give me feedback, desingns or solutions"<br>
  "This is the design we approved"<br>
  -> "What are your concerns with this design?"<br>

### Trust & Humility<br>
- What is Trust?<br>
  Trust isn't blind loyalty -> Trust goes both ways<br>
  Trust doesn't silence opposition -> Trust is feeling safe<br>
  
- When to Alter Course<br>
  1. Defend the Vision<br>
  2. Listen with Patience & Understanding<br>
  3. Stop & Reflect on the 3rd Strike<br>
   
- "Trust & Humility" Mindsets<br>
  "Trust me"<br>
  -> "I trust you"<br>
